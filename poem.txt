OPPORTUNITY

World is yours 
Opportunities are available like open doors
You control your destiny and your fate
Practice makes perfect, it’s never too late
Students or athletes
SAT’s or track meets
Strive to be greater than all those before
Step on the field and cause an uproar
Coldest in the game, people call you Toronto
Look like Ali when you pull out the combo
Students who are more than their GPA
Artistic with their work, call it papier mache
Everywhere you look, Opportunity awaits 
It’s up to you, to go out and Create.
